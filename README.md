# Algopedia
Collection of Algorithms and Data Structures , Increase your knowledge and understanding about them.

### About Repository

what all it contains and what all can be included in this:

1. It contains a huge collection of algorithms and data structures
2. Different folders for different topics which further contains different folders for based on time complexity and further on programming language. 
3. Parent folders will consists of the list of topics that are covered inside them folder wise.

### Guidelines to be followed for contribution

1. The programs should be complete.
2. There should be proper explaination for the implementation and proper comments.
3. The code should be properly indented

### Objective 
Well the final goal is to create a biggest __well curated__ list of __Algorithms and Data Structures__ ever available in open source.
