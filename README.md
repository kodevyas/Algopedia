### Guidelines to be followed for contribution

1. The programs should be complete.
2. There should be proper explaination for the implementation and proper comments.
3. The code should be properly indented

### Objective 
Well the final goal is to create a biggest __well curated__ list of __Algorithms and Data Structures__ ever available in open source.
